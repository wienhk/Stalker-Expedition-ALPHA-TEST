    Finally, I'm here to see what the zone has to offer me, but I hope for anything but a bullet in the head or losing all my body parts to radiation.
    Well, anyway, I don't know if I'm anxious or afraid, but I want to make the most of it all.
    <p>I hope to get through this whole journey with my body intact, or especially alive. Let's get going...</p>

        Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)? It seems to be an exclusive device used in the zone; I had never seen one before. I turned on my PDA and noticed a few things: Is there a specific button for faction reputations? That's interesting... We also have a map of the zone with real-time from my location and a tab for missions and messages. That seems important, I can't lose it.
        I'm in Cordon. I got the PDA from Sidorovich, who is a guy who gives out some missions and trades... I didn't pay much attention to what he said, he stinks chicken. I'm going to do some missions with him to start understanding all this.
